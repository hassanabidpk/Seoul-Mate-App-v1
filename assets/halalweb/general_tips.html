		<h1>General Tips About Halal Food</h1>
	
	<p>Assalaam-u-Alaikum all Brothers and Sisters,</p>
	
		<p>
		This document has been prepared for your acknowledgement and guidance about the food available in Korea specifically and in other countries 
		in general. Since pork is the biggest source of meat in Korea, and Koreans eat pork almost daily, so the chances become relatively high for 
		the animal byproducts to be from pork (animal byproducts in general and fats in particular are included in biscuits, chocolates, snacks and 
		breads etc.).</p>
	  <ol>
		<li><p><b>A worth mentioning issue here is that the ratio of usage of fat from pork is not equal to the %age of pork consumed as compared to the 
		other animals. This is because, other animals do not contain very high amount of fat, so they are very less likely to be used as animal fat 
		source.</b></p>
		<p>For example: Lets Assume that a product ‘A’ contains animal fat (shortening) in a country, and %age of pork consumption in that country is 70%, then it is around 90% possible for the product ‘A’ to have fat from pork as compared to other animals.
		(The numbers used in the previous example are just for elaboration and not a statistical survey)</p></li>

			<h2>Please Note:</h2> 
		
		<ol>
		<li><p>Fat is usually called “Shortening”, either from animals or plants. But, it is not all about “Shortening”, there are other words for 
		animal fat also. For example, the other word for shortening is 동물성유, which means “Animal Fat” (Most probably pork fat if major source of 
		meat is pork). </p></li>
		
		<li><p>There is one exception for the fat (shortening) to be permissible, that is, if it is from vegetable/beans source. That exception 
		쇼트닝(대무).</p></li>
		
		<li><p>The products such as biscuits and chocolates etc which are mentioned as Halal in this document are not guaranteed to be Halal, but in 
		fact we consider them Halal according to our limited findings. Again, please note that this document is not a Fatwa on foods but is to give 
		general guideline.</p></li>
		
		
		<li><p><b>About Cheese: </b>Rennet is a yellow enzyme which is obtained from the stomach of infant calves and pigs.
		According to some schools of thought such as Hanafi and Ahmad, the rennet obtained from non-Islamically slaughtered animal is ok, but for
		maliki and shaafa’ai schools of thought that rennet is Nijs (Filthy).
		We did not inquire about the source of rennet in Korea. If any people think that in Korea, Rennet is obtained from calves then they should
		correct their opinion after reading the following response of Kraft cheese manufacturer:</p><p>"Thank you very much for asking if Kraft cheese products contain any animal derivatives. Our comments here apply only to products produced in the United States. Many cheese
		products produced in the United States do contain a coagulating enzyme derived from either beef or swine. The process of changing fluid milk into cheese consists of coagulating
		the milk by one of two commonly used methods, each resulting in cheese having distinct characteristics.
		The most common method of coagulating milk is by the use of an enzyme preparation, rennet, which traditionally was made from the stomachs of veal calves. Since the
		consumption of calves for veal has not kept pace with the demand for rennet in the preparation of cheese, a distinct shortage of this enzyme has developed. Consequently, a few
		years ago it became a common practice to mix the rennet extract from calves' stomachs with a pepsin enzyme derived primarily from the stomachs of swine. These enzymes
		convert the fluid milk into a semi-solid mass as one of the steps in the manufacture of cheese. This mixture of calf rennet and pepsin extract is quite commonly and widely used
		within the United States.
		A more recent development in this area has been the use of enzymes derived from the growth of pure cultures of certain molds. These are termed microbial rennets. They are
		commonly used for the production of certain types of cheese and contain no animal products. Kraft Domestic Swiss Cheese (any Kraft Swiss not labeled "Imported" from a foreign
		country) is made with microbial rennet. Apart from Kraft Domestic Swiss Cheese, it is almost impossible for us to assure you that any hard cheese product which you might purchase
		from Kraft or any other American source is absolutely free of animal-derived enzymes.”</p></li>

		</ol>
		
		<li><p>Please Keep in Mind that if you consider a foreign brand product to be “Halal” but if it contains the ingredients written in Korean 
		language as well, then it is not necessary for that product to be Halal. This is because; the ingredients policy of a company depends upon 
		the type of local rules or population of a country. In a less “halal aware” countries like Korea, the foreign companies will use those 
		ingredients which they find easily available, so they wont bother about Halal or Haram in that non-Muslim country.
		The Halal/Haram specification in the table below has been compiled by taking the guidance from the different Islamic resources. Especially 
		the following Canadian Muslims’ website has been very helpful for any this purpose:
